# Coding Exercise

As part of our interview process, we ask candidates to complete a coding exercise to assess 
problem-solving skills, coding style, and familiarity with Python. This exercise should be completed in Python 3.

# Problem Statement
You are tasked with modifying a Python program to solve the following problems:
* communicate with a motion controller
* get access to the controller and the axes (two motors)
* move an actuator (use absolute positioning) 
* show positions before and after the move
* Display the current position (X and Y) in real-time.

The controller is am MCB2. The two motors are ....
We will also provide a computer with MS-Windows and Python 3.12 installed.
We suggest working in a virtual Python environment with PySide6 (Qt for Python) installed.

We will provide a motion controller made by Zaber Technologies.
you need two python packages: PySide6 (Qt for Python) for the user interface and zaber-motion 
to access the controller.

We will provide a motion controller simulator to show the capabilities.

[Documentation for the zaber-motion package](https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/tutorials/install/py)

Q: How yould you set up your Python environment? 
Task: Implement position setting and display 
Q: how to test hardware and GUI code?

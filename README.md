# Coding Exercise

As part of our interview process, we ask candidates to complete a coding exercise to assess 
problem-solving skills, coding style, and familiarity with Python. This exercise should be completed in Python 3.

# Problem Statement
You are tasked with modifying a Python program to solve the following problem:
* communicate with a motion controller
* get access to the controller and the axes (two motors)
* move an actuator (use absolute positioning) 
* show positions before and after the move

* connect UI to hardware

Bonus:
* update actuator position display during the move
* Display the current position (X and Y) in real-time.

We will provide a motion controller made by Zaber Technologies. 
The controller is am MCB2. The two motors are ....
We will also provide a computer with MS-Windows and Python 3.12 installed.
We suggest working in a virtual Python environment with PySide6 (Qt for Python) installed.
To access the controller, you will need to install the Zaber motion Python package.


candidate gets the simulator without blocking flag in move function.
Q: What's wrong with this unit test (long sleep)

Q: familiar wit unit testing TDD, pytest
Q: how to unit test anync move?? (add blocking flag to move function)
